# first-project-power-pi-by-extract-data-from-SQL

This project is a fully designed Sales Analytics Dashboard built in Power BI, using data extracted directly from SQL Server. The goal of the dashboard is to provide a clear, interactive, and insightful view of overall sales performance across different dimensions such as time, product categories, shipping methods, and countries.

What I Did

I connected Power BI to SQL Server, imported the required tables, and performed all necessary transformations using Power Query. After cleaning and shaping the data, I built a structured data model and created meaningful relationships between the tables. I also created several DAX measures to calculate totals, counts, and dynamic values used throughout the dashboard.

Dashboard Features

The dashboard includes several analytical components:

KPIs Section: Shows key metrics such as:

Total Orders

Orders Details

Total Amount

Total Due

Total Freight

Total Tax
These KPIs help give an immediate overview of the business performance.

Year Selection Buttons: Allow the user to filter all visuals by year (2011–2014) for easy comparison across different time periods.

Orders by Month (Line Chart): Visualizes monthly sales trends and helps identify seasonal patterns or drops in performance.

Orders by Product Category (Treemap): Displays the contribution of each product category (Accessories, Bikes, Clothing, Components) to the overall orders.

Orders by Ship Method (Donut Chart): Shows how customers prefer to ship their orders and highlights which shipping method is most commonly used.

Orders and Total Due by Country (Line + Column Chart): Combines two metrics to compare both the number of orders and the financial due amount across different countries, supporting geographic performance analysis.

Value for the Client

This dashboard enables the client to:

Quickly understand the overall sales performance through clear KPIs.

Identify top-performing product categories and markets.

Track monthly trends to support planning and forecasting.

Monitor shipping method efficiency and customer shipping preferences.

Compare countries to determine where the business is performing strongly or where improvements are needed.

Make data-driven decisions backed by clear visual insights.

The dashboard is designed to be clean, interactive, and easy to navigate, ensuring that anyone—from managers to analysts—can use it effectively.
